Description: 
        MyNotes is a sticky notes/post-it application. Notes are created using
        the system tray icon. They can be organized in categories and each
        category has a color. Images, checkboxes and a few predefined symbols
        can be inserted in the notes. The style of the text can be changed
        (alignment, style).
