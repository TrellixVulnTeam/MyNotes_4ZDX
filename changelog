      (in the right-click menu on title of each note)
    * Change symbol list in a palette + added more symbols
      (greek letters, ..). Symbols are now text and not images, so their
      style follows the one of the text. But this change means that former
      symbols (from v1.0.0) will be lost from the old notes.
    * Add import/export functions (from system tray menu), export notes to:
        - a ".notes" file that can be imported by MyNotes
        - in ".txt" but then, all formatting/images/checkboxes are lost
          and notes cannot be imported by MyNotes.
