Changelog
---------

- Version 2.0.0
    * Corrected bug: change from menu on note title not always saved
    * Corrected bug: restoring backup containing notes from deleted 
    * Corrected bug: font size / font family selection issue
      category triggered an error
    * Added warning before restoring backup to tell the user that the 
      current notes will be erased.
    * Preferences organized in tabs and category manager became a tab 
      instead of a standalone window
    * Added possibility to choose the side of the hide and roll note icons
      (in preferences)
    * Added note position option: normal, always above, always below 
      (in the right-click menu on title of each note)
    * Added mode option: 
        - note: default mode 
        - list: insert a bullet point when a newline is added
        - todo list: insert a checkbox when a newline is added
      (in the right-click menu on title of each note)
    * Changed symbol list in a palette + added more symbols 
      (greek letters, ..). Symbols are now text and not images, so their
      style follows the one of the text. But this change means that former
      symbols (from v1.0.0) will be lost from the old notes.
    * Added import/export functions (from system tray menu), export notes to:
        - a ".notes" file that can be imported by MyNotes
        - in ".txt" but then, all formatting/images/checkboxes are lost 
          and notes cannot be imported by MyNotes.
     
- Version 1.0.0
    * Initial release
